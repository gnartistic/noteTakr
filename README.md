  ## Description
  
  This app creates and stores notes. It was created using various front-end and back-end technologies, such as Node.js, multiple npm packages, html, and good ol JavaScript. Visiting the deployed application allows the user to enter some text as a 'note', and have it stored to a remote database on the application's server. The option to delete saved notes is also availible, which would result in removing the stored 'note' data from the remote database.
